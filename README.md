# youtube-dl

A simple Tkinter app used to convert Youtube videos (works with a lot of other websites as well) to *.mp3* or *.mp4* using the ```youtube-dl.exe``` and ```ffmpeg.exe``` libraries 

To use this app, you need to download the youtube-dl executable and place both the ```youtube-dl.exe``` and ```youtube_dl_GUI_interface.py``` files in the same location (for Windows).
```ffmpeg``` or ```avconv``` is required to download the audio part of a video.

```youtube-dl``` executable : https://youtube-dl.org/
